# Assignments for Principle of Programming Language Course (HK222)

*üóíÔ∏è All assignments are strictly correlated. In other words, you can not implement the present project without finishing all the previous ones üïäÔ∏è.*

## Assignment 1: Lexer/Parser

* Lexer (or Tokenizer): Implement a lexer to tokenize the input source code into a sequence of tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of meaning in a programming language, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
* Parser: Develop a parser to analyze the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer and build a syntactic structure, typically represented as an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The parser checks whether the input adheres to the language's grammar rules.
* This assignment is only the matter for you to get familiar with the codebase, so its really easy to get a perfect score ü¶´.

## Assignment 2: AST Generation
* Create a data structure to represent the hierarchical structure of the source code. The AST captures the syntactic relationships among different elements in the code. The goal is to have a structured representation that reflects the program's logic.
* This is the easiest one (about takes 2-3 days to complete). It's really easy to get a perfect score too ü¶´.

## Assignment 3: Static Check
* Perform static analysis on the AST to check for potential errors or violations of language rules without executing the code. This may include type checking, scope analysis, and other static checks to ensure the code's correctness before runtime.
* This assignment is tricky and complex, particularly on how you can store and call the variables in its scope. I painstakingly got 93/100 :)))

## Assignment 4: Code Generation
* Code Generation: Implement the generation of executable code from the AST. This involves translating the high-level language constructs into machine code or an intermediate representation. The generated code should preserve the intended behavior of the source program.
* I don't know how many testcases are passed, but I was able to successfully translate all cases from Asm 3.

## Extended Assignment for Honors (3 phases, in 3 months)

*‚ö†Ô∏èThe code for this part is not given due to some security and sensitivity issues.*

* For the standard program, we only focus on Stack-based Machine (JVM), which is way easy to implement and there is no limit on how much data the program can hold at a time. Now, you should develop the compiler to generate all MT22 code for Register-based Machine. MIPS is chosen as it is familiar and simple to our students.
* You are required to create an algorithm to efficiently manage the registers (on what to hold, what to forget). One signficant checkpoint is that your code can handle the program with total variables larger than total registers.
* As the workload is unimaginably huge, I have only implemented the compiler that serves simple, single-scoped operations.
* At the end, I got a 10 for this assignment. Maybe the instructor just only cares about the way you devise the algorithm??
